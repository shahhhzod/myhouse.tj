Hello! This repository contains the source code for a real estate sales web application. Here you will find information on how to deploy and use this application.

## Technologies

This web application is developed using the following technologies:

- **PHP** - the programming language used for the server-side development of the application. The entire backend is written in PHP using modern practices and frameworks.
- **MySQL** - the relational database used for storing information about real estate, users, and other data necessary for the application's functionality.
- **HTML** and **CSS** - used for creating the user interface, visualizing information, and styling web pages.
- **JavaScript** - the programming language used for adding interactivity to web pages. We use JavaScript to implement dynamic elements and interact with the server through AJAX.
- **Laravel Framework** - used as the foundation for developing the web application. Laravel provides convenient tools for working with the database, routing, authentication, and other aspects of development.
- **Bootstrap** - a CSS framework that helps create beautiful and responsive user interfaces. We use Bootstrap for rapid development of styles and components.
